What is LDA:
It assumes a list of topics, from which documents are generated. Find the most likely topics for each document.
Not sure yet how this will help with Cohesion!

Assumption: related concepts have similar topic probabilities based on underlying cooccurrence patterns.
What does this imply?
That the more words from a given topic a drawn, the larger the cohesion is?
